		<p>Just as Johann Sebastian Bach composed his world-famous Well Tempered Clavier, I too wished to create my own educational resource &#34;for the benefit and use of musical youth desirous of knowledge, as well as those who are already advanced in the study.&#34; But what better medium in this day and age than on the Internet?!</p>
		<p>MtSchools.net is an online music portal designed to provide a comprehensive guide and reference in all aspects of music theory.</p>
		<p>MtSchools.net is 100% free.</p>
