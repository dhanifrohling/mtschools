		<hr>
		<p>Tremolos are a musical shorthand which indicate the rapid repetition of <a href="notes">notes</a> and <a href="chords">chords</a>.</p>
		<p>There are two types of tremolos:
		<p><b>1.</b> The repetition of the same note</a> or chord, notated with strokes through the stem (or where the stem would've taken place for stemless notes)</p>
		<p><b>2.</b> The alternating repetition of two different notes or chords, notated with strokes between the two figures.</p>

		<p>A buzz roll is a special kind of tremolo used in percussion notation which indicates to repeatedly strike the note or chord as fast as possible.</p> 		<p>Buzz rolls are notated with a Z through the stem.</p>

		<h2 id="next_note">Tremolo with Next Note</h2>
		<p>Putting the tremolo slashes in-between two notes or chords indicate they are both to be alternately repeated. The same "number of slashes" rule applies here for the frequency of repetition.</p>
